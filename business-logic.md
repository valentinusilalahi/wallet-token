* Implement functions to allow the creation and destruction of tokens

### Add extra functionality to the smart contract:

* Implement functions to allow for token burning
* Implement a function to allow for the minting of new tokens
* Implement a function to allow for token locking

### Create a user interface to interact with the smart contract:

* Create a web interface that can connect to the smart contract using Web3.js
* Implement functionality to allow users to transfer tokens to other addresses
* Implement functionality to display user's token balance and transaction history

### Test and deploy:

* Deploy the smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain
* Test the contract to ensure its functionality is working correctly
* Ensure the security of the smart contract and its functionality
